## Professional Summary
I’m a hands‑on engineer who takes un-maintained verbose areas and turns them into lean, observable systems. I blend low‑level efficiency (C/C++/SIMD, Rust, Go) with pragmatic backend delivery (TypeScript/Node, Java, PostgreSQL) and ship developer productivity tooling — testing frameworks, transpilers and deployment visibility. Every abstraction is wrong, some are useful. Every line of code is a liability, simplicity is the ideal. There's a long history of failed IT projects because of code quantity over code quality, the AI future on the horizon seems to want to re-tread that same path.
