## Professional Summary
I’m a hands-on Software Engineer who likes taking messy performance, reliability, or “nobody owns this” platform problems and turning them into lean, observable systems. I bridge low-level efficiency work (C/C++/SIMD, Rust, Go) with practical backend product delivery (TypeScript/Node, Java, PostgreSQL), and I’ve repeatedly shipped tooling that unblocks teams testing frameworks, transpilers, pipeline automation, container standardisation, and better visibility into runtime behaviour. I care about long-term cost of code: every abstraction is a maintenance liability, so I bias toward simple, testable, well‑measured solutions over clever layers—especially as AI accelerates code quantity more than code quality. I enjoy pairing with stakeholders, instrumenting before optimising, and leaving systems, docs, and pipelines simpler than I found them. Looking to tackle complex distributed or performance‑sensitive problems where thoughtful engineering and developer experience meaningfully move the needle.
