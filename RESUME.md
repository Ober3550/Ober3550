## Professional Summary
Results-oriented Software Engineer delivering high-scale advertising, search, and e-commerce platform features across ad tech, retail, and logistics. Blend of low-level performance (C/C++/SIMD, Rust, Golang) and robust backend engineering (TypeScript/Node, Java, PostgreSQL) with proven solo ownership of internal tooling (mocking, transpilation, pipeline automation) and cross-team DevOps improvements (containers, Kubernetes, observability). Driven by the principle that every abstraction and line of code incurs long-term maintenance cost—favoring lean, high-quality, observable solutions over unnecessary complexity, especially in an era of abundant but uneven AI‑generated code. Passionate about developer experience, reliability, and data-driven iteration; seeking roles solving complex distributed or performance-sensitive problems.
