## Professional Summary
Results-oriented Software Engineer with experience delivering high-scale advertising, search, and e-commerce platform features across ad tech, retail, and logistics. Blend of low-level performance (C/C++/SIMD, Rust, Golang) and robust backend engineering (TypeScript/Node, Java, PostgreSQL). Proven solo ownership of internal tooling (mocking, transpilation, pipeline automation) and cross-team DevOps improvements (containers, Kubernetes, observability). Passionate about developer experience, reliability, and data-driven iteration. Seeking roles solving complex distributed or performance-sensitive problems.

> Tailor this paragraph for each application. Optionally add a quantified highlight: e.g. "Reduced test environment provisioning time by X%" or "Improved ad relevance latency by Y ms".

## Professional Experience
### Domino’s – Software Engineer  
*April 2023 – Present*
**Domain:** Global Delivery & Pickup Search (from Sep 2024), Mobile Menu & Address Experiences

- Implemented Taiwan Chinese address support and menu enhancements in React Native (Jest + Chromedriver) improving localization coverage (add metric e.g. +X markets / +Y% address match rate).
- Led platform foundations DevOps improvements: containerized Node/TypeScript services, standardized Azure DevOps pipelines, and refined Kubernetes deployment patterns (insert measurable outcome: e.g. build time ↓X%, failure rate ↓Y%).
- Built and maintained Node.js/TypeScript CI pipeline integrating Docker image hardening, test segmentation, and coverage gating.
- Designed solo package management workflow for Imposter.sh stubs (publish, versioning, contract validation) reducing manual mock sync effort (insert metric).
- Collaborated on search relevance & pickup logic (add specific algorithmic or performance contribution if possible).

**Key Technologies:** TypeScript, Node.js, React Native, Azure DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes, Bash, Python, Imposter.sh

### CitrusAd – Software Engineer  
*March 2022 – April 2023*
**Platform Scale:** 15B ad requests/month, 3.5K active brands across >100 retailer sites

- Contributed to Ad Relevancy services (Go, Postgres, BigQuery) focusing on latency optimization & ranking correctness (add quantitative latency/revenue uplift if known).
- Implemented Seller ID feature spanning Go, Java microservices and BigQuery analytical pipelines ensuring consistent identity resolution (insert accuracy % or error reduction if available).
- Owned "Imposter" internal mocking platform (Node, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform) enabling isolated test & integration workflows (add adoption metric: teams onboarded / hours saved).
- Automated infrastructure scripts (Git + Bash) to standardize environment provisioning and reduce drift.

**Key Technologies:** Go, Java, Node.js, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform

### GBST – Graduate Software Developer  
*Jan 2021 – March 2022*
**Domain:** Asset Management Platform (Pension Funds / Banks)

- Enhanced Retail Cash Accounts module (Java, GWT, Postgres) extending transactional capabilities (describe: e.g. reconciliation throughput +X%).
- Supported CHESS to CSP integration with message-driven architecture (ActiveMQ, JMS) improving settlement data flow.
- Developed a TLE→Groovy transpiler (solo project) leveraging Java/Spring & JUnit4 to modernize legacy scripting (quantify reduction in manual migration effort or LOC converted).
- Built XSLT transformations and service endpoints to streamline message interoperability.

**Key Technologies:** Java, GWT, Spring, ActiveMQ/JMS, Postgres, Groovy, XSLT

## Optimization Suggestions
1. Add metrics: latency reductions, build time improvements, adoption counts, cost savings, error rate deltas (target 70% of bullets quantified).  
2. Keep resume to 1–2 pages (current markdown renders compact; PDF likely 1 page).  
3. For highly technical roles, consider a short "Performance & Tooling Highlights" subsection (SIMD work, profiling tools, concurrency patterns).  
4. Maintain a tailored top 3–4 bullet subset per role; preserve a master file with full bullet inventory.  
5. Ensure consistent past vs present tense (current role: present; past roles: past).  
6. Group rarely-used languages (e.g., MATLAB, R, F#) under "Additional" to reduce noise if space tight.  
7. Avoid overlong tech lists—prioritize relevance to target job description.  
8. Add LinkedIn for recruiter convenience.
